# PqDL

(05.11.2018) Adding Windows Executable..

(05.11.2018) Fixing Login after Groundspeak changed site again in October 

Since unfortunately none of the other forks seems to be active anymore, I have created this new fork to keep the tool alive ..

Thanks to ChristianGK-GC, fumachu, crdx and volans who have been keeping pqDL working over the past years ! 

(19.10.2016) Groundspeak recently broke PQDL. It worked flawlessly for the past six (!) years. I'll fix it at the weekend!
